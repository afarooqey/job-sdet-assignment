# TAP Resource SDET Onboarding Plan
This onboarding plan highlights the steps to train a new TAP resource for the SDET role at EY. 

Two resources are requested to staff engagements at Mastercard (Alberta, DIP, Connect) and potentially others in the future. We are need of new resources in the Alberta engagement as two existing SDETs will go away on PTO and these new resources can fill in while they are away. It will also build a SDET pipeline for future engagements.

## Cost
A new TAP resource's expected rate is: $47/hour.

This is a four week plan.

Cost for 1 TAP resource per week = 47 x 40 x 4 = $7,520.00.

#### Total Cost for Two Resources: $15,040.00.
